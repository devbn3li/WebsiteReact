For this reason, the three European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) have offered guidance in their recent call for evidence on greenwashing. This guidance outlines core characteristics associated with greenwashing, such as misleading communications occurring intentionally or unintentionally at the entity, product, or service level. Trying to combine the various definitions proposed, greenwashing can be interpreted as: the act of providing a deceptive or inaccurate portrayal of the environmental advantages of a product, service, or organization."

This, in turn, directly causes a decline in sales, initiating a cycle of talent loss, diminished innovation, and revenue decline for the company."
